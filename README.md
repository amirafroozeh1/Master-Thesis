Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is the utilization of ICT in the transport sector to improve safety and increase efficiency and convenience. One essential enabler for
ITS is communication between vehicles and infrastructure, and from one vehicle to another. The vehicles communicate to each other in order to forward information.
Information forwarding may, especially in congested areas, be challenging due to the shared media and QoS requirements.
The main aim of this thesis is to propose an information forwarding algorithm that efficiently disseminate information within the vehicle network based on existing
literature. In addition, the algorithm is tested through simulations in realistic environment scenarios and analysed for different performance parameters such as
delay and loss. Finally, the algorithm is be discussed in relation to different QoS requirements that may apply in vehicle networks.
